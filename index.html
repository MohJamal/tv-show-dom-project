              Lord Eddard Stark, ruler of the North, is summoned to court by his
              old friend, King Robert Baratheon, to serve as the King's Hand.
              Eddard reluctantly agrees after learning of a possible threat to
              the King's life. Eddard's bastard son Jon Snow must make a painful
              decision about his own future, while in the distant east Viserys
              Targaryen plots to reclaim his father's throne, usurped by Robert,
              by selling his sister in marriage.
